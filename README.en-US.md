*Your army needs your support! Take the wheel and do it!*
**Air Attack!** is an incredible story that reveals the TowerDefense genre from the inside out.  
*The player's task* is to help the ground squad make it to the end, fighting a fierce firefight with the towers blocking the way!  
Have you ever wondered who is playing against you when you upgrade towers?  
Our game *"AirAttack!"* gives you the opportunity to have an unforgettable experience as an airplane pilot defending his ground squad heading toward the goal.  

## About the concept 

**Kirill Prokofyev, Team Leader:**
>We decided to take an arcade format that would be familiar to everyone, yet be interesting to behold in VR and revealing from a completely different angle. There are plenty of arcade shooters in the VR app stores. To cross the concepts of air-arcade and Tower Defense was our decision: only those who do not bide their time in the subway have not played the game in which you defend towers from aircraft invaders.

**Vladimir Shperling, Developer:**
>Our intention was to create a LowPoly game app, as this is the only possible style for a VR mobile app of this level. In terms of gameplay, we decided not to develop the existing hackneyed themes, such as wandering in space and VR mazes. We wanted something more.

### The result
The game won the title **"Best Game App"** at the VR 360 School competition in 2018.
